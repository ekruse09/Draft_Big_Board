He demonstrates excellent bat-to-ball skills, consistently making hard contact and spraying line drives to all fields. He has a knack for barreling the baseball and shows a mature approach at the plate with good plate discipline.   **Power:** 45 -  While not a power hitter, Bazzana has sneaky pop, particularly to the gaps. He has a quick, compact swing that generates surprising power for his size. He projects to hit double-digits in home runs at the next level with the potential for more as he develops.   **Speed:** 70 -  Elite speed is Bazzana's calling card. He's a burner on the basepaths and a true game-changer once he gets on. He has the potential to be a 30+ stolen base threat in the majors.   **Fielding:** 50 - Bazzana is a solid defender with good range and soft hands. He makes the routine plays consistently and has the athleticism to make the occasional highlight-reel play. His arm strength is average, but accurate. He has the potential to be an above-average defender at second base.  **Arm:** 50 - Average arm strength that plays well at second base. He makes accurate throws and turns the double play effectively.   **Overall:** B+  **Summary:** Travis Bazzana is a dynamic player with an exciting combination of hit tool, speed, and defensive ability. He projects as a top-of-the-order catalyst with the potential to be a difference-maker on the basepaths. His advanced hit tool and plate discipline give him a high floor, while his developing power and defensive potential provide additional upside. Bazzana has all the tools to be a long-term impact player at the Major League level.  "
